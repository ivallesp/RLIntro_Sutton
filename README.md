# RLIntro
This repository is intended for contanining a set of resources (specially jupyter notebooks) that will be self-contained. In them I try the some of the techniques and methods explained in the Sutton and Barto book: Reinforcement learning - An introduction. 

This is also intended to serve as a resource for those people that want to try reinforcement learning algorithms and do not have a strong programming skill.

Any thoughts or comments will be appreciated.

Iv√°n.
